## Audio Features

The analysis focuses on **8 critical audio features** and metadata fields:

### 🎵 Audio Characteristics

| Feature | Range | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| **Acousticness** | 0.0 - 1.0 | 🎸 Measure of acoustic vs electronic sound |
| **Danceability** | 0.0 - 1.0 | 💃 Suitability for dancing based on rhythm |
| **Energy** | 0.0 - 1.0 | ⚡ Perceptual intensity and power |
| **Instrumentalness** | 0.0 - 1.0 | 🎺 Likelihood of no vocals |
| **Liveness** | 0.0 - 1.0 | 🎤 Presence of live audience |
| **Speechiness** | 0.0 - 1.0 | 🗣️ Amount of spoken words |
| **Valence** | 0.0 - 1.0 | 😊 Musical positivity/emotional tone |
| **Tempo** | BPM | 🥁 Beats per minute |

### 📋 Metadata Fields

- **Year**: Release year (1921-2020)
- **Popularity**: Popularity score metric
- **Mode**: Musical mode (major/minor)
- **Key**: Musical key signature
- **Genre**: Predicted/assigned classifications

## Data Analysis

### 🎯 Feature Distribution

**Key Insights:**
- **Bimodal Features**: Acousticness and Instrumentalness show clear categorical divisions
- **Normal Distribution**: Danceability and Energy follow standard distributions
- **Vocal Dominance**: The majority of the tracks contain vocals (low instrumentalness)
- **High Volume Mastering**: Most songs are mastered at high volumes
- **Emotional Range**: Valence shows uniform distribution across the emotional spectrum

> **💡 Application**: These characteristics enable mood-based recommendations, energy-focused playlists, and vocal/instrumental filtering.

### Correlation Analysis

#### Strong Positive Correlations
| Feature Pair | Correlation | Insight |
|--------------|-------------|---------|
| **Energy ↔ Loudness** | 0.78 | 🔊 Louder songs feel more energetic |
| **Danceability ↔ Valence** | 0.56 | 💃 Happy songs are more danceable |
| **Energy ↔ Valence** | 0.35 | ⚡ High-energy songs often sound happier |

#### Strong Negative Correlations
| Feature Pair | Correlation | Insight |
|--------------|-------------|---------|
| **Acousticness ↔ Energy** | -0.75 | 🎸 Acoustic tracks are less energetic |
| **Acousticness ↔ Loudness** | -0.56 | 🔇 Acoustic songs are generally quieter |
| **Instrumentalness ↔ Loudness** | -0.41 | 🎺 Instrumental tracks tend to be softer |

#### Unique Features
- **Liveness**, **Speechiness**, and **Tempo** show weak correlations
- These provide unique, independent information for recommendation systems

### Trend Analysis Over Time (1925-2020)

#### 📈 Increasing Trends
- **🕺 Danceability**: Steady rise from 1970s (disco, EDM, rhythm-focused pop)
- **⚡ Energy & Loudness**: Consistent upward trend (high-energy genres, production advances)
- **🗣️ Speechiness**: Slight increase (rap, hip-hop, spoken-word elements)

#### 📉 Decreasing Trends  
- **🎸 Acousticness**: Significant decline (shift to electronic/digital sounds)
- **😔 Valence**: Lower in recent decades (darker, introspective themes)

#### 🔄 Stable Trends
- **🎺 Instrumentalness**: Remained low (vocal dominance in popular music)

> **🎭 Cultural Impact**: These trends reflect broader cultural shifts, technological advances, and changing listener preferences over nearly a century.

### Popularity Analysis

#### Key Findings
- **🎵 Valence vs Popularity**: No clear linear relationship
  - Both happy (high valence) and moody (low valence) songs achieve popularity
  - Emotional tone doesn't strictly determine mainstream success

- **🔞 Explicit Content Impact**: 
  - Explicit songs show higher median popularity
  - Suggests explicit content may attract larger audiences

## Genre Classification Strategy

### 🧠 Representative Genre Mapping via Centroid Proximity (RGCP)

Before building recommendation systems, a sophisticated **data-driven genre assignment strategy** was developed to label songs lacking genre information.

#### Three-Step Process

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Genre Audio Profiles] --> B[KMeans Clustering]
    B --> C[PCA Dimensionality Reduction]
    C --> D[Centroid Calculation]
    D --> E[Euclidean Distance Measurement]
    E --> F[Representative Genre Selection]
    F --> G[Song Genre Assignment]
```

#### **Step 1: Clustering Genre Audio Profiles**
- Applied **KMeans clustering** to `data_by_genres` dataset
- Used **PCA-transformed features** for enhanced separation
- Grouped genres by similar acoustic properties

#### **Step 2: Selecting Representative Genres**
- Calculated **Euclidean distances** between cluster centroids and all genres
- Selected the closest genre as the **cluster representative**
- Ensured each cluster maps to a prototypical genre

#### **Step 3: Assigning Genres to Songs**
- Used `.predict()` method to assign songs to clusters
- Applied representative genre labels to all songs
- Enabled scalable, consistent genre classification

> **✅ Result**: Successfully enhanced dataset with genre labels based purely on acoustic signatures, enabling downstream recommendation tasks.

## Recommendation Systems

Five distinct recommendation systems provide tailored music suggestions for different user needs and contexts:

### 1. Content-Based Recommendation

**🔍 How it Works:**
- Calculates **cosine similarity** between song feature vectors
- Ranks songs by acoustic similarity to the input track
- Returns most sonically similar recommendations

**✅ Strengths:**
- Personalized based on intrinsic music qualities
- No external metadata dependency
- Excellent for finding "songs like this"

**❌ Limitations:**
- Limited variety (acoustically similar results)
- No user behavior consideration
- May miss popular alternatives

### 2. Genre-Based Recommendation

**🔍 How it Works:**
- Filters the dataset by the specified genre
- Sorts by popularity within genre
- Returns top tracks in the category

**✅ Strengths:**
- Quick genre exploration
- Mainstream appeal within categories
- Simple, intuitive interface

**❌ Limitations:**
- No personalization (same results for all users)
- Limited to 10 clusters (insufficient granularity)
- Risk of genre misclassification
- Overlooks emerging artists

### 3. Hybrid Recommendation (Content + Popularity)

**🔍 How it Works:**
```python
hybrid_score = (similarity_weight × similarity) + (popularity_weight × normalized_popularity)
```

**✅ Strengths:**
- Balances relevance and recognition
- Adjustable weighting parameters
- Combines multiple recommendation approaches

**❌ Limitations:**
- Requires precise parameter calibration
- May have a bias toward established artists
- Complex optimisation needed

### 4. Mood-Based Recommendation

**Mood Definitions:**

| Mood | Criteria | Thresholds |
|------|----------|------------|
| **😄 Happy** | High valence + energy | Valence: 75th percentile, Energy: 60th percentile |
| **😢 Sad** | Low valence + energy | Valence: 25th percentile, Energy: 40th percentile |
| **⚡ Energetic** | High energy + tempo | Energy: 85th percentile, Tempo: 75th percentile |
| **😌 Calm** | Low energy + tempo | Energy: 30th percentile, Tempo: 40th percentile |
| **💃 Danceable** | High danceability | Danceability: 75th percentile |
| **💏 Romantic** | Moderate tempo | High valence | Moderate energy |
| **👯 Party** | High danceability | High energy | High valence |
| **📚  Focus or Study** | Low valence | Moderate energy | Instrumental preference |

**✅ Strengths:**
- Emotional and situational relevance
- No explicit input requirements
- Activity-based recommendations

**❌ Limitations:**
- Heuristic threshold estimates
- No personalization learning
- May not match individual perceptions

### 5. Era-Based Recommendation

**How it Works:**
- Filters by year range selection
- Sorts by parameters such as popularity, year, random, audio features(as defined in the analysis)
- Defaults to sorting by popularity if no sort parameter is defined
- Enables temporal music exploration

**✅ Strengths:**
- Nostalgia and historical exploration
- Time-period specific discovery
- Educational value

**❌ Limitations:**
- Depends on accurate release year data
- No feature-based similarity
- Limited to temporal filtering

### Unified Music Recommendation Tool

**Multi-Input Interface:**
```python
def get_recommendations(input_type, input_value, num_recommendations=10):
    """
    Unified recommendation function supporting:
    - Song: Specific track name
    - Genre: Music category
    - Mood: Emotional state
    - Era: Period range
    """
```
